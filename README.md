## Technology

[Zoom Room](https://umd.zoom.us/j/97370863271)

### Websites

[GitHub](https://github.com/ncsg/ursp688y_sp2025) (Coding demos and exercises)

[ELMS-Canvas](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1382201) (Readings, grades, and course communications)

### Equipment

You will need a Mac, Windows, or Linux laptop with the ability install software and join a Zoom meeting, preferably with a camera. If you have challenges accessing appropriate technology, please let me know and I will try to help.

## Course Description

Novel data and computational tools are reshaping planning, development, operation, and understanding of urban systems. These may enable more efficient and equitable distribution of resources but may also reproduce injustices and divert attention away from more straightforward solutions. This course will introduce students to basic tools and applications in data science for examining urban systems while also challenging them to critique the role of technology in improving cities. What are data science‚Äôs strengths and weaknesses? Where does it belong (or not) in our planning toolkits? Have planners and technologists appropriately espoused the capabilities of data science and smart cities? How have these technologies failed to live up to their advertised capabilities? What questions can big data answer, and what issues does it raise? These overarching questions will guide parallel technical and theoretical threads throughout the semester.

The technical thread will use coding demos and short exercises to introduce students to programming logic and Python for urban data science. Demos will be aimed at beginners: students who have never coded before. Exercises will give beginners opportunities to practice new skills and more advanced coders opportunities to address urban applications they may not have previously encountered.

The theoretical thread will use reading seminars to examine the emergence, capabilities, and limitations of smart cities, big data, and urban data science.

The threads will converge on a final project that asks students to use data science to address a contemporary planning issue and critique its capabilities and limitations. Students may either implement their project in code or write a detailed proposal for it.

This course will prepare you to:

1. Use programming logic and Python to address analytical questions, implement analyses, and share them reproducibly with industry-standard tools
2. Understand the technical and ethical limitations of digital technologies in urban contexts
3. Be professionally conversant with urban technologies, either as a coder or collaborator in design, implementation, and interpretation of urban analyses

## Components

### Coding Demos

Each class will include an interactive coding demo. In addition to introducing core techniques, these will be an opportunity to roll up our sleeves and program collaboratively as a class. They will show how programming is sometimes (or often) messy and frustrating, but achievable with a bit of grit and ingenuity. Demos will be a welcoming place for beginner coders to embrace uncertainty, ask what might feel like dumb questions, and recognize that many others are facing the same challenges.

### Reading Seminars

Each class will also include a discussion-based reading seminar. You should complete readings _ahead_ of each class and be prepared to discuss them. Readings demonstrate the use of urban data science techniques in research and discuss theoretical issues around the use of urban data science and smart cities technologies. They are meant to show both best practices _and_ opportunities for critique and improvement.

Everyone will be assigned to lead discussion for at least one class. Discussion leaders should pose questions to classmates and manage discussion about issues raised by the readings. Leaders should _not_ give presentations summarizing the readings.

### Exercises (30% of grade)

Short exercises and complementary code reviews will give you opportunities to practice coding and review how your classmates address the same problems. Each exercise will be structured around a question addressable with the techniques you have learned so-far. You are encouraged to outline solutions with pseudocode. Good pseudocode will get 90% credit, even without runnable code.

A ‚Äúclean result‚Äù means that I can rerun your code and arrive at the same number, table, figure, or other final output that you did, and that this output addresses the question posed by the exercise. There will rarely be entirely right or wrong answers.

Each exercise will be followed by a code review assignment in which you will be assigned to review the solution submitted by a classmate. Here are some guidelines for code review, adapted from John Ousterhout‚Äôs [Software Design Studio](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cs190-winter24/) at Stanford University:

- Write approximately 5-15 comments, depending on code complexity and issues/strengths.
- Focus on red flags, including issues with flow, logic, documentation.
- Is the code easily understandable? Could you use or adapt it? Identify the most complicated parts.
- How effective are variables and functions? Too generalized? Not generalized enough?

Late submissions will automatically receive a 10% penalty for each day they are overdue with a maximum late penalty of 50%.

Exercises and code reviews will be submitted as pull requests and comments on the [course GitHub repository](https://github.com/ncsg/ursp688y_sp2024).

**Note that all pull requests and comments on the course repo will be publicly viewable.**

Exercises \[and code reviews\] will be graded out of 10 points based on this rubric:

- 0: nothing handed in
- 6: sloppy or illogical code or pseudocode with no clean result  
    \[offers perfunctory praise or identifies basic issues\]
- 9: sloppy code with a clean result OR neat and logical pseudocode  
    \[identifies key strengths and issues\]
- 10: neat and logical code or pseudocode with a clean result  
    \[thorough evaluation of strengths and issues\]
- 11: wow

### Final Project (50% of grade)

The course will culminate with a final project delivered in three stages‚Äîa short proposal (10%), presentation (10%), and final product (30%)‚Äîthat uses data science to address a real-world planning problem. You may do the final project independently or with one partner.

The project will ask you to address a request from an imaginary planning agency for analysis of a potential equity gap within their city or region. You will choose which agency you are working for and the question you are asking about equitable outcomes. In designing your analysis and discussing the results, you should also consider the theoretical strengths and weaknesses of using data science and smart city approaches to examine equity and address inequities.

Projects may take two forms: (1) a functioning analysis with input data and a codebase that yield reproducible results, or (2) a proposal for an analysis that could reasonably be executed.

### Functional Analysis

You will develop a well-documented repository of data and code, along with a short accompanying narrative describing the project‚Äôs motivation, central question, approach, results, and discussion of their meaning. The narrative may be either a traditional paper or a customized webpage/site/app that combines text and graphics. Narratives for this option are expected to be 1,000‚Äì1,500 words (2‚Äì3 pages, single spaced).

### Proposal

You will write a paper with sections similar to the narrative described above, but with considerably more detail about the proposed approach. In lieu of conducting the analysis, you must convincingly portray how it will be conducted (when it is funded, of course), including proposed data sources and tools. The proposal should also include expanded discussion of smart cities theory to support and critique how your approach relates to equity, both in the substantive question it addresses and opportunities or issues it raises methodologically. This will likely draw on literature outside of what is assigned for the course. Narratives for this option are expected to be 4,000‚Äì6,500 words (8‚Äì12 pages, single spaced).

Convincing proposals are crucial in both research and practice. Imagine you are applying for a grant to fund a research project or responding to an RFP issued by a public agency. In both cases, you need to convince the reader that your approach is actionable. It should also be intelligible for a non-expert audience. Writing with this combination precision and clarity is a valuable skill to hone.

### Participation (20% of grade)

This is a hands-on, discussion-oriented course. Please come to class on time having read assigned materials and ready to engage with your fellow students. Lack of engagement in and preparedness for discussion, or substantial absence, will impact your participation grade.

## Required Reading

We will read large portions of Jennifer Clark‚Äôs book on smart cities, _Uneven Innovation_. You may want to buy a hard copy, or you can read the [ebook](https://ebookcentral.proquest.com/lib/umdcp/reader.action?docID=5763883) through the UMD library. All other readings are either available at links in the schedule or on ELMS-Canvas.

## Professional Communication

Please use this course as an opportunity to practice professional communication with me and your student colleagues. Follow professional etiquette in email correspondence. Grammarly has an [excellent guide](https://www.grammarly.com/blog/email-etiquette-rules-to-know/). Please call me ‚ÄúChester‚Äù; note that other professors may prefer more formal titles. Introduce your preferred pronouns‚Äîmine are he/him/his‚Äîand refer to others by their preferred pronouns.

I typically read and send email during regular business hours: 9am to 5pm ET on weekdays. I aim to address time-sensitive email within one business day but may take longer. If you send me an email on Friday, I may not get back to you until the next week. Please plan ahead.

## Zoom Guidelines¬≠¬≠¬≠‚Äî‚ÄòCameras On‚Äô Norm

On Zoom, we will have a ‚Äòcameras on‚Äô norm to promote focus and collegiality. Many of us will have unideal environments or technological hiccups. This is okay. Nonetheless, please do your best to minimize distractions for you and your classmates.

## Code Readability

A key aspect of writing good code is readability: can you and others quickly and easily understand it? In many cases, code will run (readable to the machine) without being readable for a human. But sloppy, unreadable code won‚Äôt be as useful for debugging, recycling, and documenting your process. I will demonstrate readable code in demos and exercise notebooks. You will need to write readable code to get full points on exercises. You will be much more appealing as a prospective collaborator or hire if you write readable code.

UC Berkeley‚Äôs introductory computer science course, [CS61A](https://cs61a.org/articles/composition/), has an excellent composition guide. [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) is a standard Python style guide. [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html) publishes their internal Python style guide. When in doubt, be consistent and use good judgement.

## Online Resources, Academic Integrity, and Troubleshooting

Coders often feel like professional Googlers. Neary endless code snippets are available on sites like [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). Generative AIs, like ChatGTP, are increasingly important tools. Human collaboration is also extremely useful for ideation and troubleshooting. This course will give you practice using diverse sources of help while not abusing them. There are both practical and ethical reasons to avoid leaning heavily on code you don‚Äôt write yourself. Code ripped from a forum, AI bot, or your too-generous friend, is unlikely to be beautiful, reliable, or efficient. Part of your job is to use resources intelligently, gut-check sources (is ChatGTP doing what I wanted?), customize examples to your purposes, and be a creative and ethical backstop to the availability of sloppy and poorly credited shortcuts.

Here are my suggestions:

- Be a compulsive Googler. Ask ChatGTP what‚Äôs wrong with your code. Ask your friends, too. Use these resources to learn and make your coding better, not to avoid learning. If I suspect you have merely copied and pasted code for an exercise, I will call you out on it. If I can‚Äôt tell, good on the AI, but bad for your learning as a coder. Why bother taking this class?
- If you‚Äôre in a Googling death spiral and just can‚Äôt find an answer, first ask a classmate‚Äîthere‚Äôs a good chance you‚Äôve confronted the same issue‚Äîthen ask me.
- You are encouraged to work on exercises with a classmate. You‚Äôre even welcome to submit the same code. Just add a comment about who you worked with to the top of your submission.

If you copy and paste a non-trivial amount of code from any source, including a generative AI, you are expected to cite your source. I often paste [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) URLs into docstrings for basic functions that I‚Äôve borrowed or adapted from posts, both to show others where I got them, and remind myself in case I want to go back to the source later. If ChatGPT helps you write a code block, make a comment about the tool name query that generated the code. This approach is both practical and ethical.

Writing that is intended to reflect your voice as an author, including any aspect of an assignment requiring narrative prose, may not be substantively authored by a generative AI. Doing so would require that you declare the AI tool as the author, which would preclude you taking credit for the product. AI tools may be used for planning and editing. This includes refining arguments or research questions, outlining, spelling and grammar assistance, and translation.

## Grading

Final letter grades will be assigned based on these ranges: 90-100%: A, 80-89%: B, 70-79%: C, 60-69%: D, 0-59%: F. Letters may be augmented by + or ‚Äì at the high or low end of each range.

## Accessibility and Disability Services

The University of Maryland is committed to creating and maintaining a welcoming and inclusive educational, working, and living environment for people of all abilities. The University of Maryland is also committed to the principle that no qualified individual with a disability shall, on the basis of disability, be excluded from participation in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities of the University, or be subjected to discrimination. The [Accessibility & Disability Service (ADS)](https://www.counseling.umd.edu/ads/) provides reasonable accommodations to qualified individuals to provide equal access to services, programs and activities. ADS cannot assist retroactively, so it is generally best to request accommodations several weeks before the semester begins or as soon as a disability becomes known. Any student who needs accommodations should contact me as soon as possible so that I have sufficient time to make arrangements.

For assistance in obtaining an accommodation, contact Accessibility and Disability Service at 301-314-7682, or email them at [adsfrontdesk@umd.edu](mailto:adsfrontdesk@umd.edu). Information about [sharing your accommodations with instructors, note taking assistance](https://www.counseling.umd.edu/ads/currentads/) and more is available from the [Counseling Center](http://counseling.umd.edu/ads/).
