    "# Exercise03\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last exercise, you used tabular analyses to examine how eviction impacts tenants in Montgomery and Prince George's Counties. In this exercise, you will use more precise, address-level data to analyze evictions across the entire state through a spatial lens.\n",
    "\n",
    "**You get to write your own research question, but with a few parameters:**\n",
    "- It should be addressable with the provided eviction data\n",
    "- It should require that you relate the eviction data to at least one other dataset, which you provide\n",
    "- It should involve at least one form of spatial analysis (e.g., proximity, overlay, or measurement of another spatial relationship)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Please write a short abstract (200-300 words) at the top of your exercise notebook that concisely summarizes your research question, how you addressed it, and the results of your analysis. Then provide reproducible code in cells below.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bonus\n",
    "\n",
    "Only a portion of the eviction records I'm providing for this exercise have addresses that can be geocoded (converting address strings to geographic coordinates) with a high degree of accuracy, or even at all. How could you assess bias in which records are accurately geocoded? (Hint: This will require you to define accuracy.) Can you write a Python script that evaluates whether higher- and lower-accuracy geocodes are randomly distributed across eviction records, or whether certain types of evictions are more or less likely to be geocoded well? **Please report your approach and findings in a separate paragraph and provide supporting code.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data\n",
    "\n",
    "[Exercise 3 Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-f7CIS-Nw9HWK1f3GUqhTLwhgtzDXVfl?usp=sharing)\n",
    "\n",
    "I'm providing you with eviction warrant data for the whole state of Maryland from 2022 through December 2024. These are from the same District Court of Maryland and Department of Housing and Community Development (DHCD) [source](https://app.powerbigov.us/view?r=eyJrIjoiYWI1Yzg0YjYtNDFkZS00MDUyLThlMDctYmE1ZjY5MGI0MWJhIiwidCI6IjdkM2I4ZDAwLWY5YmUtNDZlNy05NDYwLTRlZjJkOGY3MzE0OSJ9&pageName=ReportSection) as the data from Exercise 2, but also include street addresses. While these data are technically public, it is best practice not to store address-level data on a public GitHub repository. It is also a best practice not to commit large raw data files to Git. For both these reasons, I have shared this dataset in a [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-f7CIS-Nw9HWK1f3GUqhTLwhgtzDXVfl?usp=sharing) folder to which your UMD account has been invited. You should download `md_eviction_warrants_through_2024.csv` store it in the exercise03 directory on your computer before starting to code. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is a `.gitignore` file in the exercise03 directory that prevents any `.csv` file from being tracked by Git. As long as you don't modify this `.gitignore`, the raw data file won't get committed, pushed to your remote fork, or included in a pull request back to the course repo.\n",
    "\n",
    "## File Management and Submitting\n",
    "To submit, please:\n",
    "1. Make a new branch on your fork for this exercise.\n",
    "2. Make a notebook for your exercise with your first name as an underscored suffix (e.g., `exercise02_chester.ipynb`)\n",
    "    - You can either copy this notebook to work off of or start with a fresh notebook. Your choice.\n",
    "4. Make commits to that branch as you work on the exercise.\n",
    "5. Don't commit the eviction warrant CSV or other raw data files to Git.\n",
    "    - Instead, please add any other raw data files your analysis depends on the [Exercise 3 Google Drive Folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-f7CIS-Nw9HWK1f3GUqhTLwhgtzDXVfl?usp=sharing).\n",
    "    - The current `.gitignore` will prevent CSV files from committing. Add additional file names/extensions as necessary.\n",
    "6. Make a pull request from your branch. Ensure that the only files included in your pull request are those you intended for this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Getting Started\n",
    "To get started, here's some code I developed for geocoding the address in each eviction warrant into a geographic coordinate. You can include all or parts of this code in your own exercise, or just run this notebook to produce the `md_eviction_warrants_through_2024.geoparquet` file and import it into your own notebook to use the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### U.S. Census Geocoder\n",
    "This geocoding process makes use of a [free geocoder provided by the US Census](https://geocoding.geo.census.gov/geocoder/). It's not the most accurate geocoder available, but it's free and fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breaking Code Into Modules\n",
    "In this geocoding process, I'm demonstrating an approach to coding where you break code up into multiple modules and then import names between modules. This helps keep things tidy, allows you to easily reuse code that's generalizable between applications (e.g., the `utils.py` module here), and organize code used for more specific purposes (e.g., the `exercise03.py` and `census_geocode.py` modules).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly how packages work——modules are the basic building blocks. If you wrote an interconnected set of modules to address a certain problem space, you could publish it as a package and let others download it with conda or pip. That's how open-source software gets its start!"
