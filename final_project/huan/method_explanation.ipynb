    "# Assessing streetscape quality related to pedestrian crashes using supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Question\n",
    "The study aims to develop a supervised learning model to assess streetscape quality related to pedestrian crashes in Baltimore City at scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Methods\n",
    "The methods include four key steps: street view images collection, labeling, supervised learning training, and evaluation.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 1. Download street view images from Google Maps Platform using Street View Static API, captured in four different directions (90°, 180°, 270°, and 360°)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 2. Label images manually based on strict rubric, and employ ChatGPT to generate pseudo-labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 3. Employ Vertex AI's Auto Machine Learning to train the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Step 4. Evaluate the model’s performance based on average precision, precision and recall.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Data\n",
    "The data includes 1200 Baltimore City’s street view images, which are download from Google Maps Platform using API. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset is split as the train, validation, and test dataset. The train and validation dataset may total 1,100 Baltimore street view images (generated by ChatGPT, persudo-labeled images), with a ratio of 10:1 for training and validation. The test data contains 100 street view images (manually annotated), which have ground truth."

    "| Sidewalk Condition          | Poor sidewalk conditions (e.g., uneven, broken surfaces) increase tripping risk, discourage sidewalk use and push pedestrians onto roadways, leading to higher chances of vehicle-pedestrian conflicts. |\n",

    "| Crosswalk Presence          | Clearly marked crosswalks provide predictable crossing locations for pedestrians, improving driver awareness and reducing the probability of midblock crossing accidents. |\n",
    "| Traffic Signs Presence      | Visible traffic signs (e.g., pedestrian crossing warnings) alert drivers to pedestrian activity, enhancing compliance with traffic rules and reducing crash risks. |\n",
    "| Streetlight Presence        | Adequate streetlighting improves visibility for both pedestrians and drivers at night, reducing crash likelihood in low-light conditions. |\n",
