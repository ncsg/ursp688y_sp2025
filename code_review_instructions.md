GitHub has some terrific features for reviewing pull requests. Unfortunately, many of these features don't directly carry over to Jupyter Notebooks because of the complex structure in which they store information about cells, Markdown, etc.

As a workaround, we'll use an add-on app called GitNotebooks, which renders notebooks and allows you to make comments on individual lines, just like GitHub would for a non-notebook file.

To do a code review with GitNotebooks go to:

[https://app.gitnotebooks.com/ncsg/ursp688y_sp2025/pulls](https://app.gitnotebooks.com/ncsg/ursp688y_sp2025/pulls)

Here's a [YouTube video showing the process](https://youtu.be/NEKpoLqAKLA?t=35) (you can ignore the first 35 seconds).

1. Click on a pull request to begin reviewing it.

2. Wait for the notebook to render.

3. Click the blue [+] button to the left of a line of code on the right (green) side of the split "diff" screen. If the file you're reviewing is too large, it may only show the green side. The left (red) side shows the previous state of the code, for comparison.

4. Enter a comment and click the green [Start a review] button.

5. Enter more comments, clicking the green [Add review comment] button each time.

6. Click on [Finish your review] in the upper right.

7. Enter a final comment if you want to sum things up.

8. Click [Submit review].

Here are some guidelines for code review, adapted from John Ousterhoutâ€™s Software Design Studio at Stanford University:

- Write approximately 5-15 comments, depending on code complexity and issues/strengths.
- Focus on red flags, including issues with flow, logic, documentation.
- Is the code easily understandable? Could you use or adapt it? Identify the most complicated parts.
- How effective are variables and functions? Too generalized? Not generalized enough?
