    "## APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)\n",
    "\n",
    "APIs are an interface for accessing information. At the most general level, nearly all programs that can be accessed with code have an API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python functions, for example, are programs with APIs. You access them by calling the function name and defining arguments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, when people talk about getting data from APIs they are usually talking about web APIs\n",
    "- These are usually designed with a software architecture called [REST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/REST).\n",
    "- Using a REST API involves making a request to a URL and receiving a response.\n",
    "- Often, that response is in a format called [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON), which is structured like nested dictionaries and lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, we're going to practice retrieving data about cities from web APIs, then wrangling the data they return into a tabular format we can analyze.\n",
    "\n",
    "Making a request to an API is just another way to get data, similar to downloading it from an open data portal. Why would you bother querying an API instead of just downloading a table?\n",
    "- APIs allow programmatic access to data that can be easily scaled, replicated, and documented\n",
    "- APIs can allow customization of which data you are accessing\n",
    "- JSON allows for much more complex data structures than downloadable tables\n",
    "- APIs can be an easy way to access real-time data\n",
    "- Can we think of other reasons?"

    "### Rentcast — Paid, more complex, updated less frequently\n",
    "\n",
    "Free APIs like for CABI are becoming less common. (Does this sound familiar in light of today's reading about smart cities as emerging markets?) Many other APIs require that you pay for data, either through a subscription or for request you make. Some have free tiers, but they're usually quite limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "Several years ago, Zillow provided data about real estate markets through a free API available to the public. You now have to go through a complicated application process to get access to their API, and your use case needs to be aligned with their business model.\n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative source of real estate data is a company called [Rentcast](https://www.rentcast.io/). They allow anyone to set up an account and purchase data through an API, and it [gets expensive fast](https://www.rentcast.io/api#api-pricing). You get 50 requests free for \"development,\" but after that you pay \\\\$0.20 per request or \\\\$74 per month for a subscription to make up to 1,000 requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "They keep track of who is making requests with an 'API key', which is a long string of characters you include in your request as a 'header'. Because API keys are attached to billing information (i.e., your credit card), they're very sensitive. You ***NEVER*** want to commit your API key to GitHub or share it anywhere else publicly.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's best practice to store your API key in a separate file—I like to use a format called YAML—that you prevent from being committed by adding it to your respository's `.gitignore` file. This is a list of files that you explicitly tell git not to keep track of.\n",
